            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Well Care Spendables ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it. This policy applies to all information collected through our application and/or any related services, sales, marketing, or events.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the application, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when you participate in activities on the application, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>
            <p>The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the application, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Information You Disclose to Us:</strong> We collect names, email addresses, usernames, passwords, and contact preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> When you link your bank accounts, we collect data from your financial institutions. This includes transaction history, account balances, and account types. We do not store your bank login credentials. We use a trusted third-party service like Plaid to securely connect to your accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the application. This information does not reveal your specific identity but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, and other technical information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use personal information collected via our application for a variety of business purposes described below. We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate account creation and logon process.</li>
                <li>To post testimonials on our application with your consent.</li>
                <li>To manage user accounts and keep them in working order.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>4. Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?</h2>
            <p>We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations. We will never sell your personal financial data to third parties. We may share data with trusted third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: data analysis, hosting services, and customer service.</p>

            <h2>5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
